=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.15.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.15.2 release and
the 5.15.3 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.15.1, first read
L<perl5152delta>, which describes differences between 5.15.1 and
5.15.2.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 More CORE subs are callable through references

Perl 5.15.2 introduced subroutines in the CORE namespace.  Most of them
could only be called as barewords; i.e., they could be aliased at compile
time and then inlined under new names.

Almost all of these functions can now be called through references and via
C<&foo()> syntax, bypassing the prototype.  See L<CORE> for a list of the
exceptions.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).

Calling C<File::Glob::bsd_glob> with the unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would 
cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl program that accepts a flags value from
an external source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code
execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been
corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null.  Bug reported by Cl√©ment Lecigne.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 User-defined case changing operations.

This feature was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and has now been removed.
The CPAN module L<Unicode::Casing> provides better functionality without
the drawbacks that this feature had, as are detailed in the 5.14
documentation:
L<http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Case-Mappings-%28for-serious-hackers-only%29>

=head2 XSUBs are now 'static'

XSUB C functions are now 'static', that is, they are not visible from
outside the compilation unit. For the exceedingly rare case where
this is not desired, a new public macro C<XS_EXTERNAL(name)> can be
used in place of C<XS(name)>. C<ExtUtils::ParseXS> (C<xsubpp>)
can be made to declare XSUBs with C<XS_EXTERNAL> using the
C<EXPORT_XSUB_SYMBOLS> keyword, see L<perlxs> for details.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

L<AnyDBM_File> has been upgraded from version 1.00 to version 1.01.

This is only a minor documentation update.

=item *

L<Archive::Extract> has been upgraded from version 0.52 to version 0.56.

Resolved an issue where C<unzip> executable was present in C<PATH> on MSWin32

=item *

L<CPANPLUS> has been upgraded from version 0.9109 to version 0.9110.

=item *

L<diagnostics> has been upgraded from version 1.24 to version 1.25.

It now strips out C<SZ<><...>> formatting codes before displaying
descriptions [perl #94488].

=item *

L<Locale::Codes> has been upgraded from version 3.17 to version 3.18.

The CIA world added non-standard values, so this is no longer used as a source
of data.

=item *

L<File::Glob> has been upgraded from version 1.12 to version 1.13.

See L</Security>.

=item *

L<Math::BigRat> has been upgraded from version 0.2602 to version 0.2603.

C<int()> on a Math::BigRat object containing -1/2 now creates a
Math::BigInt containing 0, rather than -0.  L<Math::BigInt> does not even
support negative zero, so the resulting object was actually malformed
[perl #95530].

=item *

L<Pod::Simple> has been upgraded from version 3.18 to version 3.19.

=item *

L<POSIX> has been upgraded from version 1.24 to version 1.25.

L<POSIX> no longer uses L<AutoLoader>. Any code which was relying on this
implementation detail was buggy, and may fail as a result of this change.
The module's Perl code has been considerably simplified, roughly halving
the number of lines, with no change in functionality.

The file F<global.sym> is no longer needed, and has been removed. It
contained a list of all exported functions, one of the files generated by
F<regen/embed.pl> from data in F<embed.fnc> and F<regen/opcodes>. The code
has been refactored so that the only user of F<global.sym>, F<makedef.pl>,
now reads F<embed.fnc> and F<regen/opcodes> directly, removing the need to
store the list of exported functions in an intermediate file.

As F<global.sym> was never installed, this change will not be visible

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

In Perl 5.15.0 C<defined(${'$'})> stopped returning true if the C<$$>
variable had not been used yet.  This has been fixed.

=item *

C<defined(${"..."})>, C<defined(*{"..."})>, etc., used to
return true for most, but not all built-in variables, if
they had not been used yet.  Many times that new built-in
variables were added in past versions, this construct was
not taken into account, so this affected C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}> and
C<${^UTF8CACHE}>, among others.  It also used to return false if the
package name was given as well (C<${"::!"}>) and for subroutines in the
CORE package [perl #97978] [perl #97492] [perl #97484].

=item *

Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: C<defined(*{"foo"})> where "foo"
represents the name of a built-in global variable used to return false if
the variable had never been used before, but only on the I<first> call.
This, too, has been fixed.

=item *

Various functions that take a filehandle argument in rvalue context
(C<close>, C<readline>, etc.) used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, if it
was a tied variable, and warn twice, if it was C<undef> [perl #97482].

=item *

C<close> and similar filehandle functions, when called on built-in global
variables (like C<$+>), used to die if the variable happened to hold the
undefined value, instead of producing the usual "Use of uninitialized
value" warning.

=item *

When autovivified file handles were introduced in Perl 5.6.0, C<readline>
was inadvertently made to autovivify when called as C<readline($foo)> (but
not as C<< <$foo> >>).  It has now been fixed never to autovivify.

=item *

C<defined ${ $tied_variable }> used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, but
now calls it just once.

=item *

Some cases of dereferencing a complex expression, such as
C<${ (), $tied } = 1>, used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, but now call
it once.

=item *

For a tied variable returning a package name, C<< $tied->method >> used to
call C<FETCH> multiple times (even up to six!), and sometimes would
fail to call the method, due to memory corruption.

=item *

Calling an undefined anonymous subroutine (e.g., what $x holds after
C<undef &{$x = sub{}}>) used to cause a "Not a CODE reference" error, which
has been corrected to "Undefined subroutine called" [perl #71154].

=item *

Causing C<@DB::args> to be freed between uses of C<caller> no longer
results in a crash [perl #93320].

=item *

Since 5.6.0, C<*{ ... }> has been inconsistent in how it treats undefined
values.  It would die in strict mode or lvalue context for most undefined
values, but would be treated as the empty string (with a warning) for the
specific scalar return by C<undef()> (C<&PL_sv_undef> internally).  This
has been corrected.  C<undef()> is now treated like other undefined
scalars, as in Perl 5.005.

=item *

It used to be possible to free the typeglob of a localised array or hash
(e.g., C<local @{"x"}; delete $::{x}>), resulting in a crash on scope exit.

=item *

C<setpgrp($foo)> used to be equivalent to C<($foo, setpgrp)>, because
C<setpgrp> was ignoring its argument if there was just one.  Now it is
equivalent to C<setpgrp($foo,0)>.

=item *

An assignment like C<*$tied = \&{"..."}> now calls FETCH only once.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
