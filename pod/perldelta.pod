=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.13.6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.13.5 release and
the 5.13.6 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.4, first read
L<perl5135delta>, which describes differences between 5.13.4 and
5.13.5.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2  C<(?^...)> regex construct added to signify default modifiers

A caret (also called a "cirumflex accent") C<"^"> immediately following
a C<"(?"> in a regular expression now means that the subexpression is to
not inherit the surrounding modifiers such as C</i>, but to revert to the
Perl defaults.  Any modifiers following the caret override the defaults.

The stringification of regular expressions now uses this notation.  The
main purpose of this is to allow tests that rely on the stringification
to not have to change when new modifiers are added.  See
L<perlre/Extended Patterns>.

=head2 C<"d">, C<"l">, and C<"u"> regex modifiers added

These modifiers are currently only available within a C<(?...)> construct.

The C<"l"> modifier says to compile the regular expression as if it were
in the scope of C<use locale>, even if it is not.

The C<"u"> modifier currently does nothing.

The C<"d"> modifier is used in the scope of C<use locale> to compile the
regular expression as if it were not in that scope.
See L<perlre/(?dlupimsx-imsx)>.

=head2 C<\N{...}> now handles Unicode named character sequences

Unicode has a number of named character sequences, in which particular sequences
of code points are given names.  C<\N{...}> now recognizes these.
See L<charnames>.

=head2 New function C<charnames::string_vianame()>

This function is a run-time version of C<\N{...}>, returning the string
of characters whose Unicode name is its parameter.  It can handle
Unicode named character sequences, whereas the pre-existing
C<charnames::vianame()> cannot, as the latter returns a single code
point.
See L<charnames>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Stringification of regexes has changed

Default regular expression modifiers are now notated by using
C<(?^...)>.  Code relying on the old stringification will fail.  The
purpose of this is so that when new modifiers are added, such code will
not have to change (after this one time), as the stringification will
automatically incorporate the new modifiers.

Code that needs to work properly with both old- and new-style regexes
can avoid the whole issue by using (for Perls since 5.9.5):

 use re qw(regexp_pattern);
 my ($pat, $mods) = regexp_pattern($re_ref);

where C<$re_ref> is a reference to a compiled regular expression.  Upon
return, C<$mods> will be a string containing all the non-default
modifiers used when the regular expression was compiled, and C<$pattern>
the actual pattern.

If the actual stringification is important, or older Perls need to be
supported, you can use something like the following:

    # Accept both old and new-style stringification
    my $modifiers = (qr/foobar/ =~ /\Q(?^/) ? '^' : '-xism';

And then use C<$modifiers> instead of C<-xism>.

=head2 Regular expressions retain their localeness when interpolated

Regular expressions compiled under C<"use locale"> now retain this when
interpolated into a new regular expression compiled outside a
C<"use locale">, and vice-versa.

Previously, a regular expression interpolated into another one inherited
the localeness of the surrounding one, losing whatever state it
originally had.  This is considered a bug fix, but may trip up code that
has come to rely on the incorrect behavior.

In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are

=item Mac OS X

Early versions of Mac OS X (Darwin) had buggy implementations of the
C<setregid>, C<setreuid>, C<setrgid> and C<setruid> functions, so perl
would pretend they did not exist.

These functions are now recognised on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard; Darwin 9) and

=item *

The C<sv_cmp_flags>, C<sv_cmp_locale_flags>, C<sv_eq_flags> and
C<sv_collxfrm_flags> functions have been added. These are like their
non-_flags counterparts, but allow one to specify whether get-magic is
processed.

The C<sv_cmp>, C<sv_cmp_locale>, C<sv_eq> and C<sv_collxfrm> functions have
been replaced with wrappers around the new functions. 

=item *

A new C<sv_2bool_flags> function has been added.

This is like C<sv_2bool>, but it lets the calling code decide whether
get-magic is handled. C<sv_2bool> is now a macro that calls the new
function.

=item *

A new macro, C<SvTRUE_nomg>, has been added.

This is like C<SvTRUE>, except that it does not process magic. It uses the
new C<sv_2bool_flags> function.

=item *

C<sv_catsv_flags> no longer calls C<mg_get> on its second argument (the
source string) if the flags passed to it do not include SV_GMAGIC. So it
now matches what the documentation says it does.

A regular expression match in the right-hand side of a global substitution
(C<s///g>) that is in the same scope will no longer cause match variables
to have the wrong values on subsequent iterations. This can happen when an
array or hash subscript is interpolated in the right-hand side, as in
C<s|(.)|@a{ print($1), /./ }|g>

String comparison (C<eq>, C<ne>, C<lt>, C<gt>, C<le>, C<ge> and

Assigning a glob to a PVLV used to convert it to a plain string. Now it
works correctly, and a PVLV can hold a glob. This would happen when a
nonexistent hash or array element was passed to a subroutine:

  # $_[0] would have been the string "*main::foo"

It also happened when a glob was assigned to, or returned from, an element
of a tied array or hash

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
